# Machine Learning in Business Projects

This repository contains several machine learning projects focusing on applications in the business domain. Each project addresses specific business challenges and leverages machine learning techniques to derive insights and make data-driven decisions.

## Project List

### 1. Relationship of Business Indicators and Data Science Metrics

Explore the correlation between traditional business indicators and data science metrics. This project aims to uncover patterns and relationships that can help businesses better understand the impact of data science activities on key performance indicators.

### 2. User Profiling Segmentation

Implement user profiling and segmentation using machine learning algorithms. By analyzing user behavior and characteristics, this project aims to create meaningful segments for targeted marketing, personalized user experiences, and improved customer engagement.

### 3. Uplift Simulation

Simulate uplift modeling to identify the impact of marketing campaigns on customer behavior. This project helps businesses optimize marketing strategies by understanding which customers are most responsive to specific campaigns, ultimately improving conversion rates.

### 4. Churn Task

Predict and analyze customer churn using machine learning models. By identifying factors contributing to customer attrition, businesses can implement proactive measures to retain customers and enhance overall customer satisfaction.

### 5. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)

Explore the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) library to interpret machine learning models. This project focuses on explaining model predictions, providing insights into feature importance and model decision-making processes.

### 6. Look-Alike Task

Implement a look-alike modeling task to identify potential customers who resemble existing high-value customers. This project aids in targeted marketing efforts by finding individuals with similar characteristics to those who have shown positive engagement with the business.

### 7. A/B Test

Conduct A/B testing to evaluate the effectiveness of changes or interventions. This project includes the design and analysis of experiments to make informed decisions about product features, marketing strategies, or other business interventions.
